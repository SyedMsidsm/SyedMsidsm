# Hi, I'm a CSE Student & Aspiring AI/ML Engineer 👋

I am a Computer Science & Engineering student focused on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I build practical solutions using Python and Java, and I'm actively exploring Generative AI (LLMs, generative models). I create and learn through projects that bring theory into production-ready code.

---

## Areas of Expertise

- Python (data processing, scripting, model development)
- Java (software engineering, object-oriented design)
- Generative AI (large language models, fine-tuning, prompt engineering)
- Machine Learning basics (supervised/unsupervised learning, evaluation)

## Tools & Libraries

- PyTorch / TensorFlow (modeling)
- scikit-learn (classical ML)
- Hugging Face Transformers (LLMs and generative models)
- pandas / NumPy (data manipulation)
- Git, GitHub (collaboration & version control)

---

## What I'm Working On

- Learning and applying AI/ML concepts through hands-on projects and coursework.
- Building small generative-AI experiments (text generation, prompt engineering, model fine-tuning).
- Improving software engineering skills in Java for scalable applications.

## Project Highlights (replace with your projects)

- ExampleProject-1 — A short description of a Python project that demonstrates ML or automation. (link to repo)
- ExampleProject-2 — A Java application showcasing strong design and problem solving. (link to repo)
- Generative-AI-Playground — Experiments with LLMs and generative models (notes and notebooks). (link to repo)

## Education

- B.Tech / B.E. in Computer Science & Engineering — currently pursuing

## How to Collaborate

- Interested in internships, mentorship, or research collaborations in AI/ML and generative models.
- If you have a project or opportunity that aligns with my skills (Python, Java, Generative AI), feel free to get in touch.
